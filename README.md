# predict-fraud-transaction-aiml
The objective is to develop a mathematical model to identify risky transactions using the available features of the 'Financial Transactions' dataset.

Dataset: data_FinancialTransactions.csv (uploaded as separate file)
Metadata file: metadata_FinancialTransactions.txt (uploaded as separate file)

Implemented the predictive models/classifiers using the following classification approaches:
 - Logistic Regression
 - Decision tree
 - Ensemble Methods
 - K-Nearest Neighbour

Performances of each model/classifier considering the given dataset using different evaluation measures such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC-ROC. Shown the comparison chart in Python notebook.

Decision Taking: Identify the model, which you think is the best amongst all the models that have been trained with reasoning.
